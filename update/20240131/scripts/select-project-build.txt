[select-project-build scipt]

It is not recommended building the following projects for the RPi3 B+ platform: libagar, lzsa, mame, OVCC, nitros-code, nitros9, qb64, ugBasic and ugBasic-beta.

This is primarily due to insufficient resources of the RPi3 B+.  In some cases, unloading the Display Server (Wayland / X) can help, but your results may vary.
