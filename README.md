# CoCo-Pi Project (64bit)

The CoCo-Pi project is based on work from many other projects and individuals. The sum of all the pieces became the Raspberry Pi OS based Coco-Pi distribution for the RPi3, RPi4 & RPi400. This repo only includes packages, scripts and/or configuration files at the moment, but this will allow for some very easy updating for bugs, upgrades or enhancements.
